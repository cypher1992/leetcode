Chapter 1:
    Class|Description|Immutable?
    bool|Boolean value|Yes
    int|integer (arbitrary magnitude)|Yes
    float|floating-point number| Yes
    list|mutable sequence of objects|No
    tuple| immutable sequence of objects|Yes
    str|character string|Yes
    set |unordered set of distinct objects| No
    frozenset|immutable form of set class| Yes
    dict|associative mapping (aka dictionary)| No

    Sequence Types
        are list, tuple, and str.
        list = []
            - list are zero index are similar to an array
        Tuple = ()
            - tuples are immutable version of a sequence
        str = "" or '' or """""" or ''''''
            - str is specifically designed to represent an immutable sequence of
            characters
    Set and Frozenset
        set = {}
            - set class represent the mathamatical notion of a set, namely
            a collection of elements, without a duplicate
            - No order
        frozenset =
            - is a immutable form of a set type, so it is legal to have set of frozenset
            - frozenset()
